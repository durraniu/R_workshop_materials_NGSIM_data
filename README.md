## Introduction to data analysis with R using NGSIM vehicle trajectory data

This intensive workshop offers attendees the opportunity to learn various data analysis techniques in R programming language. The data set used in this workshop is [NGSIM vehicle trajectory data](https://datahub.transportation.gov/stories/s/Next-Generation-Simulation-NGSIM-Open-Data/i5zb-xe34/).

At the end of the workshop, attendees will create a shiny application to explore the Gipps car-following model. All materials will remain available on Github.
